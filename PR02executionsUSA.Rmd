### Packages Used

```{r}
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```

### Read Data Files

```{r}
cap_punish <- readRDS("cappunish.rds")
death_row_size <- readRDS("deathrowsize.rds")
death_sentences_NC <- readRDS("deathsentencesNC.rds")
```

### Plot #1: How Many States Have Capital Punishment? 

* Create a barplot for the variable `dp2`. 
* Use `color =` and `fill =` to format the bars.
* Use `labs()` to add a title and better axis labels.
* Apply a built-in theme from **ggplot2** or **ggthemes**.
* You may optionally add a subtitle or caption to the plot.
* This plot should *not* have a visible legend anywhere on it.

```{r}

```

### Plot #2: Capital Punishment By Region of the U.S.

* Create a barplot for the variable `region`. 
* Use `fill =` to shade each bar according to `dp2`.
* Change the `position =` to set each bar equal to 100%.
* Use `width =` to make the bars narrower than the default.
* Use `labs()` to add a title, axis labels, and a better legend label.
* Use `scale_fill_manual()` to choose a different color scheme for the plot. 
* Use `theme()` to move the legend to the bottom of the plot instead of the right
* You may optionally add a subtitle, caption, or ggplot2 built-in theme to the plot.

```{r}

```

### Plot #3: Number of Prisoners on Death Row

* Create a barplot for the total number of prisoners (y) in each year (x).
* Fill the bars using the variable `decade` and outline them all in black.
* Set the width of all the bars so there is no visible gap in between them.
* Scale the x-axis to include a tick mark at each decade (1970, 1980, etc).
* Scale the y axis so that it is numbered 0, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, etc.
* Use `labs()` to add or change the title, axis labels, and legend label. 
* Use `theme()` to do the following:
    * center your title
    * set the plot background to white or blank
    * set all axis tick marks to transparent or blank
    * set the major x-axis gridlines to transparent or blank
    * set the major y-axis gridlines to light gray
* You may optionally change the bar color scheme used in your plot

```{r}

```

### Plot #4: Number of Executions Since 1976

* Create a violin plot for the variable `post1976` (use `y = 0`)
* Add a boxplot and set the width so it fits inside the violin plot
* Fill each plot with a color of your choice (be colorblind-aware)
* Scale the x-axis of the plot so that it counts in increments of 25
* Get rid of all y-axis markings/gridlines using `scale_y_continuous()`
* Add a title, x-axis label, and a caption to identify the large outlier
* Add the built-in theme `theme_linedraw()` or `theme_minimal` to the plot

Hint: You can use the `NULL` vector in functions like `scale_y_continuous()`

```{r}

```

### Plot #5: Death Sentences in NC Since 1976

Create a time series plot of death sentences in North Carolina. Use three geometries on this plot: `geom_area()`, `geom_line()` and `geom_point()`. Use `geom_vline()` to add a vertical line for 2001. The significance of this year is that the General Assembly modified the death penalty statute in several ways, including giving prosecutors the discretion to *not* seek the death penalty in cases where it previously would have been mandatory. Format and label your plot in such a way that the information it conveys would be clear to the reader (i.e., the plot is reasonably stand-alone).

```{r}

```
